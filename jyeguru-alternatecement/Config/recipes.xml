  <!--
    Total Concrete Mix ingredients (no skills):
    - 13x Small Stones
    - 1x Crushed Sand
    - Some forge burn time

    1 Sand = 1 Small Stone (Vanilla Recipe)

    Adjusted recipe has same overall cost, replacing the forge burn time with an extra stone->sand processing step.
    Also without the skill bonus from Advanced Engineering, overall cost is slightly higher.
